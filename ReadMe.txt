This Mock up is a simple Starbucks landing page with a basic javascript product switcher.


The design was inspired by the Youtube Channel : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Q6RvKvd7o&t=126s&ab_channel=OnlineTutorials


For this project i used html 5 semantics
sass
and an external javascript file for the interactivity.

SOON I'LL BE DOING THE MOBILE VERSION!

also a big thank you to OnlineTutorials for the smart ideas.
